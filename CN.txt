NIC:- Network Interface Card
MAC:- Media Access Control
Every network has network interface card and every NIC has a unique MAC address

LAN:- Local Area Network
Ethernet is used to connect LAN devices

Unicast is one to one communication
Layer 2(l2) segment = broadcast domain
Router break up broadcast domains

OSI-Model:-
Layer 7 - Application
Layer 6 - Presentation
Layer 5 - Session
Layer 4 - Transport
Layer 3 - Network
Layer 2 - Data Link
Layer 1 - Physical

Ip address is a layer 3 network address
ARP:- Address Resolution Protocol
Each layer 2 segment has its own unique IP address range, its own IP subnet
The router is a default getway

IP Address Range:-
10.1.1.11 => Octes
each of these sction of the address are made up of eight binary digits 

Subnets:-
10.1.1.0 /24
10.1.2.0 /24 
10.1.0.0 /16

This 2 subnets we call a slash 24. That means that the first 24 bits are the network address. 
each one of theese chunks of the address is eight binary digits.
24 networks we have got an address range of 10.1.1.0 through 255.

10.1.0.0 /16 => which means that the first 16 bits are reserved for the network itself.
10.1.0.0 /16
10.1.0.0 - 
10.1.255.255 
So this 10.1.0.0 address can include all of the addresses between 10.1.0.0 through 10.1.255.255
10.1.1.0 /24
Network Address: 10.1.1.0
Default Gateway: 10.1.1.1
Broadcast Address: 10.1.1.255
Usable:- 10.1.1.2-10.1.1.254

The ARP table maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

VLAN:- Virtual Local Area Network
VLAN:- Logical segmentation
Physical switch has a single connection to the router. That connection is what we call a trunk port.
Acces port belongs to single VLAN
Each VLAN has a subnet
Each VLAN is a broadcast domain
Each VLAN has a MAC table
Trunk port - multiple VLANs
Access port - singlr VLAN

WANs:- Wide Area Networks
Ipsec VPN:- Connects one network to another network
IPSEC VPN is secure connection over internet
Routes will have public IP addresses

Layer 2 VPN 
L2VPN extend a segment over a deographic distance and over the internet
Disaster recovery
Mobility

Network Redundancy:-
SPOF - Single point of failure

DHCP:- Dynamic Host Control Protocol
Static IPs are manually set
DHCP:- Automatic IP Assignment
DHCP request is a L2 broadcast
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew:- new DHCP IP address.

DNS:- Domain Name System

Private Network:-
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

NAT:- Network Address Translation

Wireless LAN (Wifi Network):-
Wireless Network Different frequency:-
2.4 Ghz
  150 feet / 45 Meters (indoor)
  300 feet / 90 Meters (outdoors)
  Appx. 150 Mbps is a typical max
  
5 Ghz
   50 Feet / 150 Meters (indoors)
   Appx. 1300 Mbps max speed
   
SSID - Service Set Identifire

What is IPFIX / Netflow?
Netflow is a network protocol that was devloped by Cisco. And the objective of NetFlow is to provide visibility into network traffic by capturing data about that network traffic.
Netflow and IPFIX basically same thing 
The main diffrence between netflow and IPFIX:-
Netflow is a devloped by cisco. 
And IPFIX is an industry standard, and so Ipfix is going to be available on non Cisco equipment

Networkflow Traffic Details:-
Source and destination IP addresses.
Source and destination ports.
The type of protocol used (e.g., TCP, UDP)
Bytes and packets sent and received.
Timestamps for the start and end of the flow.

NTP:- Network Time Protocol
NTP Sources:-
Traffic folws over UDP port 123
NTP is easy as 123
We can get the current time from the Naval Observatory

Overview of IP Address:- 
Types of IP Address:-
Public/Private IP Address
Private IP Address:-
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

Public IP Address:-
Globally unique and routable on the internet.
Assigned by internet service providers (ISPs).
Used to identify devices on the public internet.
Typically used for routers and firewalls facing the internet.

Private IP Address:-
Not globally unique used within local networks.
Assigned by network administrators within private networks.
Don't work on the internet

IPV4 Address Struture:-
IPV4 Address 192.168.0.6
Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0
Default Getway 192.168.0.1


Classful vs. Classless addressing:-

0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255
only possible IP addresses start with 0.0.0.0. we have four octes and the largest any number can be within one of those octes is 255.
Class A Address Ranges:-
1.0.0.0 - 127.0.0.0
16,777,214 devices :- 16 million devices that can get an address within that class A address range.	
Class B Address Ranges:-
128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
65,534 devices
Class C Address Ranges:-
192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0
254 devices

Converting Binary and Decimal:-
For Ex:- 135 is an octet
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 :- 8 binary digits 
check 128 is lessthan 135
now some calculation:- 137-128 =7
check 7 is graterthan 64,32,16,8,4
then check 7-4 = 3
check 2 is graterthan 2 and 1
10000111 = 135

192.168.1.35
192=> 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 => 128 + 64 = 192
168=> 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 => 128 + 32 + 8 = 168 
1 =>  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 => 1 = 1
35 => 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 => 32 + 2 + 1 = 35

Why 255?
IP Address the highest possible vaule of any octect is 255.
All of those binary values of a single octet 1
128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 255
The 8 binary digits the maximum value is 255

192.168.1.10
Octet 1: 192 => 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Octet 2: 168 => 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
Octet 3: 1   => 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
Octet 4: 10  => 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1

192.168.1.10
11000000.10101000.00000001.00001011

255.255.255.0 


What is Subnetting:-
Subnetting is the practice of dividing a larger coputer network  into smaller, more manageable segments to improve network efficiency, security, and IP address allocation.
